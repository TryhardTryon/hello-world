# hello-world
Tutorial repo

Apparently I'm supposed to add a little bit about myself. I go to UCCS and I study Computer Science. I'm currently completing a BA, and a minor in Game Design. I work in IT at the University, though that may be changing soon. I'm married, and am looking to start a family when I graduate.
